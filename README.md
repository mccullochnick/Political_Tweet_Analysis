# Political_Tweet_Analysis
Text mining and analysis of political tweets

## Project Description
This project uses the TWitter APIv2 and various text mining and analysis techniques to examine changing word choice in political discussion on twitter. Identifying linguistic patterns in a chosen sphere and tracking those trends through an evolving context are key challenges for text-miners. This project and the accompanying paper analyze political discussion and jargon from 2007-2022 on Twitter. To do so it had to address 1) How to identify “political” tweets and exclude others. 2) How to collect a body of tweets large enough for analysis. 3) How to parse and analyze that data. Analysis of the collected tweets revealed notable attributes in twitter usage, language make-up and issues for future projects.

## Data
I don't include the original tweets here.  I do include the accounts and Twitter handles that I sampled and my sampling methodology is included in the project markdown and paper.  Although the tweets themsevles aren't included here, the process is replicable and tweets are publicly available.  The finalized dataset included 343,978 unique tweets, from 1,105 accounts.

Finding a centralized list of political accounts proved difficult. Several sources were used to find relevant accounts.  Twitter has lists of accounts determined to be government affiliated, the House Press Gallery provides the Twitter accounts for current members of the House of Representatives. The largest source of data no member names and social media accounts came from a joint database maintained by GovTrack, ProPublica, Maplight, and FiveThirtyEight among other groups and individuals.  The full sources are described and cited in both the markdown and the accompanying paper.

## Twitter API
The project wouldn't have been possible without Twitter's APIv2 and academic research access.
